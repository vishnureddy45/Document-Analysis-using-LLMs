# Text-Summarization-Model-using-LLMs

To build a text summarization model, first, we need to choose a pre-trained language model like T5. Then, we need to tokenize the input text, which converts it into a format the model can process. The next step will be to use the model to generate a summary by specifying parameters like maximum length and beam search for better results. The final step will be to decode the generated tokens back into readable text and adjust parameters to improve the summary quality.

So, let’s start building a text summarization model using LLMs with Python step by step.

Step 1: Select a Suitable LLM - Choose a pre-trained model designed for text generation tasks. The T5 model (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) by Google is one such model that is effective for various text-based tasks like translation, question-answering, and summarization. 

Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Install the transformers library by Hugging Face. It provides easy access to various pre-trained models and tokenizers.

pip install transformers

Step 3: Load the Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer
Now, we need to import the T5Tokenizer and T5ForConditionalGeneration classes from the transformers library. Select a model like t5-small, t5-base, or t5-large based on the requirement and computational capacity:

To select between t5-small, t5-base, or t5-large, consider your computational resources and accuracy needs. t5-small is faster and requires less memory, which makes it suitable for quick tasks or limited hardware. t5-base offers a balance between speed and performance, ideal for general use. t5-large provides the highest accuracy but needs more memory and processing power, which makes it better for scenarios where performance is more important than speed.

Step 4: Prepare the Text for Summarization
Next, we need to define the text that needs to be summarized. The text should be prefixed with the keyword “summarize:” for the T5 model to recognize the task properly:

The “summarize:” prefix for the T5 model is necessary because T5 is a “text-to-text” model that needs to understand what task it should perform (e.g., summarization, translation, or question-answering). The prefix helps the model identify that it should generate a summary of the input text. Without this instruction, the model might not produce the intended summarization output.

Step 5: Tokenize the Input Text
The next step is tokenization. Tokenization is the process of converting text into a sequence of integers that represent the model’s vocabulary. The max_length parameter helps manage large texts by truncating or limiting the input size.

Step 6: Generate the Summary
Now, use the generate method to produce the summary. Important parameters include:

max_length: The maximum number of tokens in the output.
num_beams: The number of beams for beam search (higher values improve results but increase computation).
length_penalty: Adjusts the length of the summary (penalizes lengthy outputs).

Step 7: Decode and Display the Summary
The final step is to decode the generated summary using the tokenizer to convert the tokens back to readable text
