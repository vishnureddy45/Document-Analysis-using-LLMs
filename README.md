# Text-Summarization-Model-using-LLMs

Building a Text Summarization Model with LLMs
To create a text summarization model, we can leverage pre-trained language models like T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer). Below are the steps to build the model:

Step 1: Select a Suitable LLM
Choose a pre-trained model optimized for text generation tasks. Google’s T5 model is ideal for tasks like translation, question-answering, and summarization. You can select from variants such as:

t5-small: Faster, low memory usage—ideal for quick tasks on limited hardware.

t5-base: Balanced speed and accuracy for general use.

t5-large: Higher accuracy but resource-intensive—best for performance-critical applications.

Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Install the Hugging Face transformers library for easy access to pre-trained models and tokenizers.

Step 3: Load the Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer

Step 4: Prompt the user to enter the text to summarize

Step 5: Tokenize the Input Text
Convert the text into a sequence of integers using the tokenizer

Step 6: Generate the Summary
Use the model's generate method to create the summary. Key parameters include:

max_length: Maximum number of tokens in the summary.
num_beams: Number of beams for beam search (higher values improve quality but require more computation).
length_penalty: Penalizes overly lengthy summaries to improve coherence.

Step 7: Decode and Display the Summary

Summary
To build a text summarization model:

Choose a pre-trained model like T5.
Tokenize the input text to prepare it for the model.
Generate a summary using parameters like max_length and num_beams.
Decode the output tokens into readable text and refine the parameters to improve summary quality.
